# Streamlining Job Applicaitons Using Priority Based Scheduling

This project introduces a robust priority-based scheduling algorithm for job applications, where priorities are assigned through a weighted scoring system based on diverse factors such as user preferences, skills match, and company reputation. The calculate_priority function employs a sophisticated algorithm to precisely evaluate each application, while the prioritize_applications method organizes them efficiently. The schedule_applications method adeptly manages deadlines and user-defined thresholds for scheduling. Visualizations like pie charts and timelines provide valuable insights into the distribution and timeline of scheduled job applications. With diverse input applications reflecting real-world scenarios, the algorithm demonstrates both efficiency, with O(NlogN) time complexity and O(N) space complexity, and a comprehensive approach to application evaluation, aligning seamlessly with course principles.
